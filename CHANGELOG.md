# Changelog

All notable changes to the **Habeas** extension. The format is based on
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/). Versioning is a 3-part **milestone**
(`0.2.0`) plus an optional 4th **dev suffix** (`0.2.0.1`, bumped on every change, never tagged);
only milestones are tagged and shipped to the stores. Dates are `YYYY-MM-DD`.

Update this file in the **same commit** as every version bump (see `CLAUDE.md` → Maintainer playbook).
Older detail (0.1.x public beta) lives in [`docs/CHANGELOG.md`](docs/CHANGELOG.md).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Record mode captures realtime transports** — the in-session recorder now wraps `WebSocket` and
  `EventSource` (in learn mode only) and records the connect URL + a capped, chronological sample of sent
  (subscription) and received (data) frames into their own buffer. Recording was fetch/XHR-only, so
  `wss://` sources (Trade Republic-style) were **invisible** to it — a helper browsing such a site captured
  nothing usable. Now a plain browse session captures what a maintainer needs to author the transport, and
  the author panel reports the frame/socket count instead of "no requests". (First step toward making
  recording practical for non-technical helpers; auto-drafting realtime/mtop sources is still manual.)
- **Live recorder monitor** — while recording, the author panel now shows, in plain language and updated
  every ~2s, what the capture is seeing: documents found, data lists, realtime frames, which transport(s)
  detected, and whether it's ready to auto-draft here or needs a maintainer. A non-technical helper can
  tell it's working without pressing Analyze or understanding fields.
- **Capture classification** (`infer.js#summarizeCapture` + `findComponentGroups`) — the inference now
  recognizes **component-keyed lists** (sibling-key responses like mtop/DIDA `pc_om_list_order_*`, not just
  JSON arrays / HTML tables) and classifies the transport (HTTP / mtop / WebSocket / SSE), counting the
  user's data and honestly flagging signed/streamed sources as "needs a maintainer" rather than
  mis-drafting them.
- **PII-redacted recording handoff** (`lib/redact.js`) — a helper can share a recording with a maintainer
  without leaking personal data. The redactor keeps the STRUCTURE a maintainer needs (endpoint path
  templates, field names, response shapes, pagination params, transport) and replaces every VALUE with a
  type-classified placeholder (`[date]`, `[amount:EUR]`, `[id]`, `[email]`, `[iban]`, `[text]`, …); auth
  tokens, cookies, and page text are never included at all. The author panel's live monitor offers
  “Share recording (anonymized)” (with a “See what will be shared” preview) → downloads a redacted JSON
  bundle to send. Backed by a dedicated security test asserting no PII of any shape survives.
  - Handoff **keeps non-PII query-param values** (`redactParam`): filter/enum/date values an author needs
    for pagination (`paginationType=CLOSE`, `monthFilter=202506`, `from=2026-06-01`) are preserved, while
    ids, tokens, long numbers, emails, and multi-word values are still redacted.
  - Record mode now **captures document (PDF/Excel/CSV) downloads** via a learn-mode `webRequest` watcher
    — a PDF opened by a link/navigation/download bypasses the fetch/XHR hook (so recordings showed 0
    documents); the watcher records document-type responses on the recorded domain into the assets buffer.
- **Handoff collaboration workflow** — a helper can now **send a redacted recording to the Habeas team**
  (not just download it) and collaborate to turn it into a source. The author panel gains a “Send to the
  Habeas team” button + an optional credit handle; submissions are keyed by a **pseudonymous contributor
  id** (`lib/submitter.js`, no PII, no account). Backed by the `api.habeas.dev` handoff endpoints
  (reception, a two-way Q&A thread, status, and attribution) — see the api service.
  - **My contributions** inbox (Settings tab) — the return half of the loop: it polls the contributor's
    own submissions, shows each one's status, and opens the two-way conversation so they can answer the
    team's questions or re-record. An unread-reply badge appears on the tab.
  - **Marketplace attribution** — a source can carry a `contributors` handle list (in the adapter, carried
    into the catalog index); the marketplace card credits them (“🙌 Contributed by …”). Closes the loop:
    record → send → collaborate → published & credited.
  - **Correlation-preserving redaction** — an id VALUE now redacts to a stable `[id#N]` per distinct real
    value across the whole bundle, so a maintainer can trace that a path segment, a header, and a response
    field hold the SAME id (answering “where does this come from?” structurally, no questions, no value
    revealed). Personal values (names/IBANs/cards/emails/phones) are never correlated.
  - **System/operation codes preserved** — short numeric codes (≤4 digits, e.g. an operation-type code
    `0006`/`0019`, a center/department code) are kept verbatim since they identify the system, not the
    person; longer numbers (postcodes, accounts) are still redacted.
  - **Redacted JWT claims** — SPAs often build a path/query id from a claim in the session token, which
    made that id untraceable. The handoff now includes the JWT's decoded PAYLOAD claims (claim names +
    value-redacted, correlated) as `tokenClaims` — so a JWT-derived path id (e.g. `[id#9]`) is traced to
    its claim structurally. The raw token, header, and signature are never included.

## [0.3.0] — 2026-07-16

### Added
- **Download planner** — schedule recurring deliveries from a source to a destination. Versatile
  recurrence: every day; weekly on chosen weekdays; monthly on days-of-month; the nth (or last)
  weekday of the month; the nth (or last) business day (Mon–Fri) — all at a local `HH:MM`. Runs in
  the live browser session (never stores credentials): if not signed in when it fires, it opens the
  source tab + notifies, then retries every 15 min (up to 4×) before deferring to the next
  occurrence; a browser that was closed runs the missed schedule on next start (catch-up). Uses
  `chrome.alarms` (cross-browser). New **Planner** tab in Settings.
- **AliExpress** (`aliexpress`) — order history over **Alibaba's `mtop` gateway**, via a new reusable
  **mtop transport** that also covers any Alibaba property (Taobao/Tmall/Lazada/1688…). Runs in the
  site tab and reuses the app's own live request payload (`window.__habeas_mtop`, stashed by the page
  hook) + its `lib.mtop` signing — no hardcoded payload, no forged anti-bot signature. Orders are
  extracted from the DIDA component response via `itemsFromKeys` (a `pc_om_list_order_*` key prefix,
  wildcard-tolerant to component-version bumps). Pagination bumps the page field through the seed's
  nested stringified-JSON layers (`pagePath` with `~` markers: `params~.data~.…pageIndex`). The seed is
  acquired **automatically**: the transport nudges the orders tab (scroll to the sentinel + click any
  "load more") until the app fires its own signed request — no manual scroll — preferring the POST pager
  body and falling back to the init GET payload for single-page accounts. Per-order **receipt** as a
  self-contained printable **HTML invoice**, generated from the `queryorderreceiptinfo` mtop call (a known
  flat payload — no seed) via a declarative receipt template that uses AliExpress's own field labels.
- Runtime: **mtop detail calls** (`api.detail.mtop` with an explicit `params` payload) and a **declarative
  receipt template** for `renderInvoiceHtml` (`api.detail.template`: title/meta/blocks/items/totals with
  `{dotted.path}` tokens resolved against the detail JSON) — a reusable HTML-invoice layer, data not code.
  The detail call is **locale-global**: params resolve from the user's own session in-page (`@seed:FIELD`
  reuses the app's own request locale, `@tz` the browser offset), dropping unresolved ones so the server
  falls back to the account default — no hardcoded country/language.

### Fixed
- `normalizeDate` handles `DD Mon, YYYY` (e.g. AliExpress `15 jun, 2025`) — was shifting a day via the
  `Date()` fallback + UTC conversion.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **WebSocket transport** (`api.ws`, in-tab `makePageWs`) — the first non-HTTP source mechanism: run
  a `connect → sub → paginate → collect` loop inside the site tab so the session cookie rides the
  socket. Optional per-item detail phase.
- **Trade Republic** (`traderepublic`) — the transaction **timeline over WebSocket**, with per-item
  detail (ISIN, quantity × price) and monthly **account-statement PDF** + **transactions CSV** (async
  export **job**: `api.pdf.job` — POST start → poll status → download).
- `synthetic: "months"` now carries per-month `fromDate`/`toDate` bounds.

### Fixed
- Synthetic monthly documents (statements) are no longer marked as *existing* in **All documents**
  until actually delivered — phantom months (before the account opened) don't show a file anymore.

## [0.1.68] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Revolut** (`revolut`) — personal **transactions** (`to` timestamp cursor) with a per-pocket
  **account filter**, and **account statements** (PDF/CSV, async-generated then downloaded
  cross-domain from the signed Google Storage URL). Cookie session + captured `x-device-id`.
- Runtime: **currency-aware minor-unit scaling** (`minorUnits`, per ISO 4217 exponent); the
  **`cursorFromItem`** pager (next cursor = the oldest row's field); **cookie-source header
  capture/replay** (`auth.replayHeaders` on `mode:cookie`); regex **field extraction**
  (`normalize.fields`, e.g. an ISIN out of an icon path); `api.pdf.poll` (async doc generation).

## [0.1.67] — 2026-07-15

### Added
- **Openbank España** (`openbank-es`) — integrated statements, per-account **monthly movement
  statements** (PDF/XLS), and **transactions** (SCA-safe 90-day window).
- Runtime: token-only cookie policy (`auth.cookies:false`, avoids oversized-cookie HTTP 413); array
  `itemsPath` (first non-empty wins); cursor `nextIsUrl` / `stopPath` / `cursorParams`;
  `groups.derive` (split a packed field); session **keep-alive**; `keepRaw` store re-download.

### Dev tooling
- **PII/secret pre-commit guard** (`scripts/scan-pii.mjs` + hook) — blocks committing real account
  numbers, IBANs, live tokens, or raw capture dumps.
